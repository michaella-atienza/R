## Welcome to my GitHub repository R portfolio!
Here, you'll find a collection of R projects that showcase my coding skills in R, featuring models used in machine learning. 

## Projects
1. **K-Means Clustering with Iris Data:** Visualization and using K-Means Clustering to cluster different Iris species, and subsequently an elbow plot to determine appropriate k value.
2. **K-Nearest Neighbours & Cross-Validation on Credit Card Data:** Using KNN to make a model that classifies credit card eligibility, and cross-validation to test model quality.

## About Me
I'm a recovering plant research technician who fell in love with data analysis, and is now determined to pivot from the bench and greenhouse into data analytics. Now, I am currently pursuing a remote Masters in Analytics with Georgia Tech while looking for my next position in data.
